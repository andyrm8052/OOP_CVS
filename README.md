The problems I'm having with these codes are that parse is not 
defined, but it is. Calculation.test.js apparently reads "parse" as
defined. In the other hand Calculator.test.js doesn't think "parse"
is defined. Lastly, I won't know for sure if the test are working
correctly because of these syntax errors.
